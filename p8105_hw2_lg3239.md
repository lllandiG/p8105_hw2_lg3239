## Problem 1

``` r
NYC_trans = 
  read_csv(
    "files/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv", 
    col_types = cols(Route8 = "c", Route9 = "c", Route10 = "c", Route11 = "c")) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(
    line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, 
    starts_with("route"), entry, exit_only, vending, entrance_type, 
    ada) %>%
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, 'YES' = TRUE, 'NO' = FALSE))
```

``` r
view(NYC_trans)
```

This dataset contains variables line, station_name, station_latitude,
station_longitude, route1, route2, route3, route4, route5, route6,
route7, route8, route9, route10, route11, entry, exit_only, vending,
entrance_type, ada. It has 1868 rows and 20 columns. The cleaning steps
begin with importing the file and specifying the `route` columns all be
character type. Then using `select()` to select the variables that we
want. `mutate()` and `recode()` are used to transform `entry` from
character type to logical values. However, this dataset is not tidy
because the route numbers are supposed to be values of a variable route.

``` r
NYC_trans %>%
  select(line, station_name) %>%
  distinct()
```

    ## # A tibble: 465 × 2
    ##    line     station_name            
    ##    <chr>    <chr>

    ## 10 4 Avenue Atlantic Av-Barclays Ctr
    ## # … with 455 more rows

There are 465 distinct stations. `distinct()` gives all unique
combinations between line and station names.

``` r
NYC_trans %>%
  filter(ada == TRUE) %>%
  select(line, station_name) %>%
  distinct()
```

84 stations are ADA compliant Use `filter()` to select the dataframe
according to ADA compliance, then select the `line` and `station_name`
to form distinct combinations.

``` r
NYC_trans %>%
  filter(vending == 'NO') %>%
  pull(entry) %>%
  mean()
```

    ## [1] 0.3770492

About 0.38 of station entrances/exits without vending allow entry. Use
`filter()` to select the dataframe according to vending availability,
then choose the `entry` value since its logical, `mean()` is able to
cast it as numeric.

``` r
NYC_trans %>%
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    names_to = 'route_num',
    values_to = 'route') %>%
  filter(route == 'A') %>%
  select(line, station_name) %>%

There are 60 distinct stations serve the A train, and 17 of them are ADA
compliant. `pivit_longer()` is used to make route number and route name
as distinct variables, and `filter()` is used according to train A and
ADA compliance. Similar to steps above, obtain the unique combinations
between line and station names.

## Problem 2

``` r
mr_trash_wheel = 
  readxl::read_excel("files/Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = 1, range = "A2:N549") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls, digits = 0)))
mr_trash_wheel['trash_wheel'] = 'mr_trash'
view(mr_trash_wheel)
```

`read_excel()` with specified `sheet` number and `range` is used to
import the Mr.Trash Wheel dataset. For cleaning,
`janitor::clean_names()` is used. `mutate()`, `round()`, and
`as.integer()` are used to round the number of sports balls to the
nearest integer. An addition variable `trash_wheel` with value
`mr_trash` is added, specifying the dataset it belongs to. This dataset
contains dumpster, month, year, date, weight_tons, volume_cubic_yards,
plastic_bottles, polystyrene, cigarette_butts, glass_bottles,
grocery_bags, chip_bags, sports_balls, homes_powered, trash_wheel, with
547 rows and 15 columns. It has the information about the various trash
collected according to date.

``` r
prof_trash_wheel = 
  readxl::read_excel("files/Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = 2, range = "A2:M96") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(year = as.character(year))
prof_trash_wheel['trash_wheel'] = 'prof_trash'
```

Similarly, `read_excel()` with specified `sheet` number and `range` is
used to import the Professor Trash Wheel dataset. For cleaning,
`janitor::clean_names()` is used. `mutate()` is used to conver `year`
variable to character type as same as Mr.Trash Wheel. An addition
variable `trash_wheel` with value `prof_trash` is added, specifying the
dataset it belongs to. This dataset contains dumpster, month, year,
date, weight_tons, volume_cubic_yards, plastic_bottles, polystyrene,
cigarette_butts, glass_bottles, grocery_bags, chip_bags, homes_powered,
trash_wheel, with 94 rows and 14 columns. It has the information about
the various trash collected according to date. But it does not have the
`sports_balls` variable as Mr.Trash Wheel.

``` r
trash_wheel_df =
  full_join(mr_trash_wheel, prof_trash_wheel)
```

    ## Joining, by = c("dumpster", "month", "year", "date", "weight_tons",
    ## "volume_cubic_yards", "plastic_bottles", "polystyrene", "cigarette_butts",
    ## "glass_bottles", "grocery_bags", "chip_bags", "homes_powered", "trash_wheel")

``` r
mr_trash_wheel %>%
  filter(year == '2020') %>%
  pull(sports_balls) %>%
  sum()
```

    ## [1] 856

``` r
prof_trash_wheel %>%
  pull(weight_tons) %>%
  sum()
```

    ## [1] 190.12

`full_join()` is used to merge the two datasets, keeping data that
appear in either of the two. The resulting dataset has variables
dumpster, month, year, date, weight_tons, volume_cubic_yards,
plastic_bottles, polystyrene, cigarette_butts, glass_bottles,
grocery_bags, chip_bags, sports_balls, homes_powered, trash_wheel, and
is 641 x 15.

Using `prof_trash_wheel` on the `weight_tons` variable, and using
`sum()`, the total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel is
190.12 tons. Using `mr_trash_wheel`, `filter()` by 2020, on the
`sports_balls` variable, and using `sum()`, the total number of sports
balls collected by Mr. Trash Wheel in 2020 is 856.

## Problem 3

``` r
pols_month_df = 
  read_csv("files/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-") %>%
  mutate(month = gsub("0", "", month)) %>%
  mutate(month = month.abb[as.numeric(month)]) %>%
  mutate(president = case_when(prez_gop == 1 ~ "gop",
                               prez_dem == 1 ~ "dem")) %>%
  select(-prez_gop, -prez_dem, -day)
```

    ## Rows: 822 Columns: 9
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl  (8): prez_gop, gov_gop, sen_gop, rep_gop, prez_dem, gov_dem, sen_dem, r...

    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
view(pols_month_df)
```

`read_csv()` is used to import the pols_month dataset. `separate()` is
used with `sep = "-"` to breakup `mon` into `year`, `month`, and `day`.
Then `mutate()` is used to change the `month` to numeric values (without
zero) and using `month.abb[]` to obtain month abbreviation. `mutate()`
is also used with `case_when()`, specifying when `prez_gop` is 1, add
the `president` variable with value `gop`, and when `prez_dem` is 1, add
with value `dem`. Finally, remove the `prez_gop`, `prez_dem`, `day`
columns by `select()`. This dataset contains 822 observations of 9
variables related to the number of national politicians who are
democratic or republican at the time. The variables are year, month,
gov_gop, sen_gop, rep_gop, gov_dem, sen_dem, rep_dem, president. The
year range is from 1947 to 2015.

``` r
snp_df = 
  read_csv("files/fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") %>%
  separate(date, into = c("month", "day", "year"), sep = "/") %>%
  mutate(month = month.abb[as.numeric(month)]) %>%
  select(-day) %>%
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year)) %>%
  mutate(year = if_else(year > 49, year + 1900, year + 2000)) %>%
  mutate(year = as.character(year)) %>%
  relocate(year) %>%
  arrange(year, month)
```

    ## Rows: 787 Columns: 2
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (1): date
    ## dbl (1): close

    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
view(snp_df)
```

`read_csv()` is used to import the dataset. `separate()` is used with
`sep = "/"` to breakup `date` into `month`, `day`, and `year`. Then
`mutate()` is used to change the `month` to numeric values (without
zero) and using `month.abb[]` to obtain month abbreviation. After
removing `day` using `select()`, `mutate()` is used to convert year to
numeric type, and with `if_else()` to convert year that is greater than
49 to four digits 19xx, otherwise to 20xx. `year` should be in character
type. Finally, `relocate()` year to first column and `arrange()`
according to year and month. This dataset contains 787 observations of 3
variables related to representative measure of stock market. The
variables are year, month, close, in which `close` is the closing values
of the S&P stock index on the associated date. The year range is from
1950 to 2015.

``` r
unemploy_df = 
  read_csv("files/fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") %>%
  pivot_longer(
    Jan:Dec,
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "rate"
  ) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(year = as.character(year))
```

    ## Rows: 68 Columns: 13
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl (13): Year, Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
view(unemploy_df)
```

`read_csv()` is used to import the dataset. `pivit_longer()` is used on
variables from `Jan` to `Dec` to cast the month and rate as distinct
variables. `mutate()` changes `year` to character type. This dataset
contains 816 observations of 3 variables. The variables are year, month,
rate. The year range is from 1948 to 2015.

``` r
result_df = pols_month_df %>%
  left_join(snp_df) %>%
  left_join(unemploy_df)
```

    ## Joining, by = c("year", "month")
    ## Joining, by = c("year", "month")

``` r
view(result_df)
```

Merge `snp_df` to `pols_month_df` using `left_join()`, and `unemploy_df`
to the resulting dataset using `left_join()`. The final dataset contains
822 observations of 11 variables. The year range is from 1947 to 2015.
The variables are year, month, gov_gop, sen_gop, rep_gop, gov_dem,
sen_dem, rep_dem, president, close, rate.
